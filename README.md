# MongoDB-News-Scraper

News Scraper employs client-side web scraping to allow the user to scrape a news website and return articles, save and be able to comment. 

The front end aspect was developed by using HTML, CSS, Handlebars and Google Fonts. The back end used Node, Express, Mongo DB, Mongoose, Cheerio & Axios.

The site displays a simple page showing the options of scraping news articles, clearing articles and going to your saved articles. 

It also allows the user to add notes to the articles that they saved and be able to return to them again. 

The user can also delete their saved article individually.
