# MongoDB-News-Scraper

News Scraper employs client-side web scraping to allow the user to scrape a news website and return articles, save and be able to comment. 

The front end aspect was developed by using HTML, CSS, Handlebars and Google Fonts. The back end used Node, Express, Mongo DB, Mongoose, Cheerio & Axios.

The site displays a simple page showing the options of scraping new articles, clearing articles and going to your saved articles. 

It also allows the user to add a note onto the articles that they saved and return to them to see their comment again. The user can also delete their saved article individually.
